## Description

The goal of this project is to implement an RNN to generate fake TV scripts using [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. The neural network will generate brand new TV scripts based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
